One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas How he got into my pajamas I will never know.
The horse raced past the barn fell.
The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the malt.
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.
I never said she stole my money.
All the faith he had had had had no effect on the outcome of his life.
The horse raced past the barn fell.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
A woman without her man is nothing.
The old man the boats.
Time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
